                        I just downloaded the app, and so far, it's been really fun! As someone with ADHD, 
                        having the little gacha machine at the end of every lesson has been motivating me a ton. All of the graphics are very cute as well, and there's multiple ways of learning new characters for those who learn in different ways! It also runs very smooth, 
                        no glitches so far. Overall, a great app; far better than Duolingo, as another user put it.
